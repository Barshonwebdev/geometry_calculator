        <h2>what is a triangle?</h2>
        <p>A triangle is a basic geometric shape that consists of three sides and three angles. It is one of the fundamental shapes in geometry and has various properties and classifications based on the lengths of its sides and the measures of its angles </p>

        <h2>what is a rectangle?</h2>
        <p>A rectangle is a four-sided flat shape in Euclidean geometry, characterized by having opposite sides that are parallel and equal in length, and all four angles are right angles (measuring 90 degrees each). It is a special type of quadrilateral, a polygon with four sides.</p>

        <h2>what is a paralleogram?</h2>
        <p>A parallelogram is a special type of quadrilateral, which is a polygon with four sides. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel, meaning they never intersect and remain equidistant from each other. Additionally, opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.</p>

        <h2>what is a rhombus?</h2>
        <p>A rhombus is a special type of quadrilateral, which is a polygon with four sides. In a rhombus, all four sides are equal in length, making it a special case of a parallelogram. Additionally, the opposite angles of a rhombus are equal, and each angle measures less than 180 degrees.</p>

        <h2>what is an ellipse?</h2>
        <p>An ellipse is a geometric shape that resembles a flattened circle. It is a type of conic section, formed when a plane intersects a cone at an angle that is not perpendicular to the base of the cone. An ellipse has two main axes: the major axis and the minor axis.</p>
